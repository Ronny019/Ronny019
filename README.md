### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Mainak Pal Chowdhury.
I am currently pursuing M. Eng Masters in Applied Data Science at the University of Victoria Canada.

My passion for data drives me to learn more about the tools and the underlying mathematical concepts in Data Science.

Data by itself is a mess. I aim to use my knowledge of data to unearth this mess of raw data that the world produces and generate meaningful results.

I am looking to learn more about statistical data modelling.
